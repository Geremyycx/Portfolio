# <b>Signature Work Portfolio - Gerome Coralde</b><br />

<ins><b>Introduction</ins></b><br />
Welcome to my Signature Work Portfolio! This portfolio showcases three projects I completed while studying at the University of St. Thomas as a Computer Science major and a Data Science minor. Each project serves as a testament to the knowledge I gained, assimilated, and applied, reflecting my growth and proficiency in systematic problem-solving and creativity within the fields of technology and data.<br />

### <b> Project One: Interactive History Sniffing: CAPTCHA Project</b><br />
<ins><b> Description</ins></b><br />
This project involves the development of an interactive CAPTCHA program that can detect if a user recently visited certain websites. In this case, the project was designed to, (pretending) the user is a college student, recommend the user different majors to choose from given their web browsing history. This project is intended to capture the essence of studying computer systems under attack from a malicious adversary, simulating real-world cybersecurity challenges.

<ins><b>Features</ins></b>
- User Verification System
- Website History Detection
- Security Measures
- Personalized Recommendations

<ins><b>Technologies Used</ins></b>

- Virtual Machine 
- HTML & Python
- Web Framework

### <b> Project Two: Dummy Student List using Microsoft Power Apps </b><br />
<ins><b> Description</b></ins><br />
This dummy project simplifies a student-list management system by offering a user-friendly interface for adding, editing, and removing student information. This low-code application, using Microsoft Power Apps, which collaborates with Excel, ensures efficient data synchronization and streamlining administrative tasks as changes in the app are automatically reflected in the spreadsheet. This intuitive design allows an effortless experience as Power Apps automatically applies the template for the user(s) to modify. 


<ins><b>Features</ins></b>
- User Interface Design
- Low-Code Development
- Data Synchronization
- Automated processes

<ins><b>Technologies Used</ins></b>

- Microsoft Power Apps & Excel
- Data Integration Tools

### <b> Project Three: Poverty in the Midwest </b><br />
<ins><b> Description</b></ins><br />
Poverty currently affects 12% of the United States population which has been a situation discussed throughout the world. To prevent people from going into poverty, the study aims to predict what factors influence it. Our sample size of 1055 cases used Midwest states' county demographics from SimplyAnalytics using U.S. Census Bureau data collected from 2010-2020.


<ins><b>Features</ins></b>
- Exploratory Data
- Factor Analysis 
- Structural Equation Modeling

<ins><b>Technologies Used</ins></b>

- Microsoft Excel
- R & RStudio


<ins><b>Conclusion</ins></b><br />
These projects have significantly contributed to my understanding and apply my skills in various areas of Computer Science. I'm fascinated by the dynamic nature of this field as technology rapidly evolves every day. These projects are a tangible testament to the real-world applications of applied knowledge, systematic problem-solving, and creative thinking within the advanced field. As I continue to explore this advanced field, I am eager to learn and discover the endless possibilities this [technology] world has to offer. Feel free to explore the repositories linked above for a more detailed look at each project.<br />
